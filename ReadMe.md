6. **Create a pull request** to this repository with your completed test.
7. **Submit your pull request by [insert deadline date and time here]**.

## Tasks

### Task 1: PHP

1. **Build a Microservice**: Create a microservice in PHP that performs currency conversion. The service should:
   - Accept a source currency, target currency, and amount via a REST API.
   - Fetch the latest exchange rates from a reliable API (e.g., Open Exchange Rates).
   - Return the converted amount in the target currency.
   - Implement error handling for invalid inputs and API failures.

2. **Data Processing Script**: Write a PHP script that processes a large CSV file containing user data. The script should:
   - Read the CSV file in chunks to handle large files efficiently.
   - Validate the data (e.g., email format, required fields).
   - Insert valid records into a MySQL database.
   - Generate a report of invalid records and save it as a new CSV file.

### Task 2: HTML & CSS

1. **Interactive Dashboard**: Design and implement an interactive dashboard using HTML and CSS. The dashboard should:
   - Display various widgets (e.g., charts, tables, notifications).
   - Be fully responsive and accessible.
   - Use CSS animations to enhance user experience.

2. **Custom Form Elements**: Create custom-styled form elements (e.g., checkboxes, radio buttons, select dropdowns) using only HTML and CSS. Ensure they are accessible and work consistently across different browsers.

### Task 3: JavaScript

1. **Real-Time Chat Application**: Develop a real-time chat application using vanilla JavaScript. The application should:
   - Allow users to join chat rooms and send messages.
   - Display messages in real-time without refreshing the page.
   - Use WebSockets for real-time communication.

2. **Data Visualization**: Create a data visualization tool using JavaScript (e.g., D3.js or Chart.js). The tool should:
   - Fetch data from an API.
   - Display the data in an interactive chart or graph.
   - Allow users to filter and manipulate the data.

### Bonus Task

1. **Security Enhancements**: Review your code and implement security best practices (e.g., input validation, SQL injection prevention, XSS protection). Document the security measures you have taken.
2. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize your code for performance. Provide comments explaining the optimizations you have made.

## Submission

Once you have completed the tasks, please submit your work by creating a pull request to this repository. Ensure your code is well-documented and follows best practices. **The deadline for submission is 3 days from the date of issued**.

Good luck!
